How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The + and - symbols allow us to see what was used to be in the old version 
    (and was removed) and what was added to the new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We spend less time searching through code to identify bugs, and when we 
    have to revert to a previous version, itâ€™s easy.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro is that you can choose when the versions are made based on some 
    important work that you did. The con is that you have to remember to do the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
